# Guide to Elaris: A New Home for Humanity

## Overview of Elaris

**Elaris** is a vibrant, human-habitable planet designed for sustainable colonization, slightly larger than Earth with a diameter of 14,200 km and a gravitational pull of 1.05g due to a dense iron-nickel core. It features a 26-hour day and a 390-day year, with a mild axial tilt of 20° creating gentle seasonal shifts. Its breathable atmosphere (23% oxygen, 75% nitrogen, with trace gases) enhances stamina but requires adjustment to avoid mild euphoria. Elaris is encircled by three vast oceans—the Azure Expanse, Twilight Sea, and Starlit Veil—teeming with edible aquatic life, supporting its four continents: Vireon, Thalara, Zoryn, and Kaelis.

### Geography
- **Continents**: 
  - **Vireon**: A temperate supercontinent with fertile plains, crystalline mountains, and bioluminescent forests, centrally located with access to the Azure Expanse.
  - **Thalara**: A tropical archipelago in the southwest, featuring volcanic islands and floating isles supported by magnetic fields.
  - **Zoryn**: An arid continent in the southeast, marked by red canyons, oases, and resonating quartz-like "Singing Stones."
  - **Kaelis**: A polar continent in the northwest, dominated by icy tundras and geothermal springs.
- **Climate**: Ranges from tropical in Thalara (25°C–35°C) to subarctic in Kaelis (-20°C to 5°C). Vireon maintains a temperate range (10°C–25°C), while Zoryn’s deserts swing from -10°C at night to 45°C by day.
- **Resources**: Freshwater from Zoryn’s aquifers, fertile soil in Vireon, elarite (a lightweight, super-strong crystal) across all continents, and abundant marine life in the oceans.

### Unique Features
- **Bioluminescent Flora**: Plants emit blue-green light at night due to symbiotic microbes, creating surreal landscapes across the continents.
- **Moonweave Event**: Two moons—Luneth (large, silver) and Sylis (small, reddish)—produce intricate oceanic light patterns monthly.
- **Magnetic Auroras**: Vibrant emerald-to-violet displays, visible at mid-latitudes due to a strong magnetic field.
- **Floating Isles**: Thalara’s low-density volcanic rock forms ecosystem-supporting islands.
- **Tidal Harmony**: Predictable tides from dual moons aid navigation and fishing schedules.

### Native Ecosystem
- **Fauna**: Non-sentient species include skydancers (winged, iridescent creatures) and grazelopes (massive, herbivorous land-dwellers).
- **Flora**: Features spiral trees, color-changing mosses, and glowing vegetation adapted to each continent’s climate.
