                <h2>Overview of Elaris</h2>
                <p><strong>Elaris</strong> is a vibrant, human-habitable planet designed for sustainable colonization, slightly larger than Earth with a diameter of 14,200 km and a gravitational pull of 1.05g due to a dense iron-nickel core. It resides within the <strong>Aetherion Nexus</strong> solar system and features a 26-hour day and a 390-day year, with a mild axial tilt of 20° creating gentle seasonal shifts. Its breathable atmosphere (23% oxygen, 75% nitrogen, with trace gases) enhances stamina but requires adjustment to avoid mild euphoria. Elaris is encircled by three vast oceans—the Azure Expanse, Twilight Sea, and Starlit Veil—teeming with edible aquatic life, supporting its four continents: Vireon, Thalara, Zoryn, and Kaelis.</p>
